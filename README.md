### Steps to Run Locally  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   https://github.com/Shibudubey7/nextjs-assignment.git
   cd nextjs-assignment

2. Install dependencies:

     npm install

3. Start the development server:

   npm run dev
4. Open the application in your browser:

    Navigate to http://localhost:3000

 **  Important Note**
 Please use this url http://localhost:3000(your localhost port ) in place of .env variable.
Do not use npm run build or yarn build for production builds because the project relies on localhost API endpoints, which will not function during the build process. The application is designed for local development only.
